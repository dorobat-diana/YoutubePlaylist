#Project Description:

The Interactive Tutorial Management System is a software application designed to streamline the management and organization of educational tutorial content. Its intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) provides users with a seamless experience for creating, editing, and accessing tutorials in various formats, such as CSV and HTML. Below is an overview of the project's key features and functionality:

Main Menu:

The application opens with a user-friendly main menu featuring two primary options: "CSV" and "HTML." Users can choose between these two file formats for managing tutorials.
Admin Mode:

Upon selecting either "CSV" or "HTML," users can enter "Admin Mode," which grants access to advanced tutorial management capabilities.
Tutorial List Display:

In Admin Mode, a list of tutorials is displayed in a dedicated section of the GUI. This list shows essential details about each tutorial, including title, presenter, duration, likes, and a link.
Tutorial CRUD Operations:

Admins can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tutorials:
Add: Admins can add new tutorials by filling in details like title, presenter, duration, likes, and a link. Clicking "Add" updates the tutorial list.
Update: Admins can select a tutorial from the list and modify its attributes, such as title, likes, and link, by entering new values and clicking "Update."
Delete: Admins can remove a tutorial from the list by selecting it and clicking "Delete."
Tutorial List Management:

Admins can view, edit, and delete tutorials from the list. The list is automatically updated after each operation.
Save and Display:

Admins can save the tutorial list to a file (CSV or HTML) and also open it within the application for quick reference.
User Mode:

Users can switch to "User Mode" to explore tutorials. User Mode offers functionality for searching tutorials by presenter and adding tutorials to a playlist.
Search by Presenter:

Users can enter a presenter's name and click "Search" to filter tutorials by that presenter. The results are displayed in a separate list.
Playlist Management:

Users can create and manage playlists by adding tutorials to them. They can also remove tutorials from their playlist.
Navigation and Interaction:

Users can navigate between different sections of the application, such as switching between Admin and User Modes, searching for tutorials, and managing playlists.
Like Tutorials:

Users can express their appreciation for tutorials by clicking the "Like" button, which increases the tutorial's likes count.
Responsive Design:

The GUI is designed to be responsive and user-friendly, ensuring a seamless experience on different screen sizes.
Overall, the Interactive Tutorial Management System provides an efficient and user-friendly platform for both administrators and users to manage, explore, and engage with educational tutorial content in a structured and organized manner. Whether you are a content creator, educator, or learner, this application simplifies the process of tutorial management and access.
